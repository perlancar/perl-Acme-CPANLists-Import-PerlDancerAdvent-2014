The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<p>All too often beginners would stumble over the behavior of static file
serving in Dancer2. The idea made sense on paper but somehow, when you
put it in practical terms, it wasn't just a hurdle but a real pain to
constantly headbutt without realizing, <i>"damn it, that again!"</i></p>
<p>The good news is we fixed it. The bad news is you will have to read this
article to understand what we're talking about. The treat is we will explain
how it was fixed after we explain what was wrong.</p>
<h2><a name="ex_static"></a>Ex-static</h2>

<p>The logic for request serving in Dancer 1 is simple. It consists of the
following steps run in order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Try_to_render_a_static_file_from__code_public___code_"></a><b>Try to render a static file from <code>public/</code></b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Try_to_render_an_action___a_user_s_route"></a><b>Try to render an action - a user's route</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Try_to_render_an_AutoPage___a_user_s_template"></a><b>Try to render an AutoPage - a user's template</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Give_up_and_render_a_404_page"></a><b>Give up and render a 404 page</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a> these items were broken down into composable units known as
handlers. <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2::Handler::File">Dancer2::Handler::File</a> serves static files (which
the DSL keyword <code>send_file</code> uses internally) and
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2::Handler::AutoPage">Dancer2::Handler::AutoPage</a> renders template files.</p>
<p>These handlers were, when configured to be used (or according to the
defaults), merged into an application as regular routes. To make sure they
don't cause any confusion, they were merged at the very end. Oops. Strike
one!</p>
<p>The following order was created:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Try_to_match_a_user_route"></a><b>Try to match a user route</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Try_to_match_a_static_file_route__Handler__File_"></a><b>Try to match a static file route (Handler::File)</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Try_to_match_a_rendered_template__Handler__AutoPage_"></a><b>Try to match a rendered template (Handler::AutoPage)</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Give_up_and_render_a_404_page"></a><b>Give up and render a 404 page</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it seems reasonable for user-defined routes to trump static resources
and templates, people were not expecting it to happen, which led to a few
peculiar situations.</p>
<h2><a name="problem_1__greed_is_not_good"></a>Problem 1: Greed is NOT good</h2>

<p>In order for these routes to accept <i>any</i> input, they use a greedy
<b>megasplat</b> route, which captures everything:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/**' =&gt; sub {
    # I SEE ALL ROUTES
    # (as long as they are a GET request)
};</pre>

<p>(Users can define these routes as well, of course.)</p>
<p>The first manifestation of the reshuffling in order of execution occurred
when users defined greedy <b>megasplat</b> routes which accidentally captured
all static requests as well:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/**' =&gt; sub {
    # handle what I think is a user request
    # but can also be a static file request
};</pre>

<p>Now users had to account for static files being asked of them. Ouch. This
is actually the small problem.</p>
<h2><a name="problem_2__a_hook_to_kill"></a>Problem 2: A hook to kill</h2>

<p>Remember hooks? Sure you do. Every route can have hooks. Amongst available
hooks there are the <b>before</b> and <b>after</b> hooks which control the execution
sequence of a matched route, allowing you to call code before and after it is
executed, respectively.</p>
<p>How does that come into play? Since the <b>File</b> and <b>AutoPage</b> handlers
create regular routes (just like a user might), the <b>before</b> and <b>after</b>
hooks actually apply to them.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yes! This meant that, for example, your <b>before</b> route hooks were called for
static files. If they contained a security check (for which many users use
them), you might accidentally prevent a file from being rendered. Strike two!</p>
<p><i>"You can't see the lacking access picture because you lack access!"</i></p>
<h2><a name="plack_strikes_back"></a>Plack strikes back</h2>

<p>Before we hit a <i>strike three</i> we decided to fix this. Since we're
depending on <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack">Plack</a> and the associated technology to help resolve so many
issues, we looked there.</p>
<p>One wonderful part of Plack is the middlewares. One specific middleware
that came to our rescue was <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Middleware::Static">Plack::Middleware::Static</a>. It allow us to
render static files from the <code>public/</code> directory before it actually
reaches our application and Dancer2 dispatching code at all. Wait, what?</p>
<p>The Plack middleware wraps the Dancer2 code and checks for static files on
each request before it sends it off to Dancer2. If it can find a file that
matches the request, it will serve it directly instead of passing it
onwards.</p>
<p>This means we're back to a proper static file serving behavior. They are
now served properly before the app and the hooks do not apply to them.</p>
<p>We still kept the <b>File</b> handler to provide <code>send_file</code>, but it
is no longer in charge of automatically serving static files.</p>
<p>The <b>AutoPage</b> handler is kept as is because hooks make sense in rendering
templates. You might want to use the <b>before_template</b> hook in order
to provide default variables that will be available in every template
rendering (including automatic ones served by <b>AutoPage</b>) - which is
something you will not have with static content.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Wonderful work by
<a href="https://metacpan.org/author/RUSSELLJ">Russell @veryrusty Jenkins</a>
solving this thorn in Dancer2 and providing consistent behavior that
makes sense.</p>
<p>If you meet him, offer him a drink. He's Australian so he'll take it. :)</p>
