The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<p>A question we often get asked when we promote <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a> is <i>"How do I migrate
my code to Dancer2?"</i></p>
<p>There had been some changes between the versions - big enough to require an
entirely new namespace. What were they? How do we migrate?</p>
<h2><a name="changing_the_namespace"></a>Changing the namespace</h2>

<p>The reason we changed the namespace wasn't really due much to the change a
user will necessarily see, but more due to the incredible difference in core
architecture, and CPAN's inability to maintain two running versions in the
same namespace, as mentioned in the
<a href="http://advent.perldancer.org/2014/2">previous article</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a> is actually a complete rewrite. It had small portions of the code
moved and some of the documentation was copied over, but mainly it is
completely restructured.</p>
<p>It no longer relies on reinventing the wheel as much. Users simply didn't care
about installing another module or two or three or even more. At the same
time, enough tools we written to still allow you to get away with not being
able to install dependencies, so the entire problem became moot.</p>
<p>For example, Having <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib">local::lib</a> allows you to install an entire module tree
in a local user's directory (not requiring administrative privileges). Having
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/fatpacker">fatpacker</a> allows you to fatpack your entire Dancer2 application in a single
file. Having <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Carton">Carton</a> allows you to package it all nicely. Having <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Pinto">Pinto</a>
allows you to set up an entire personal CPAN for your company. Things are
much easier.</p>
<p>(Watch for additional articles that cover <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/fatpacker">fatpacker</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Carton">Carton</a> in this
advent calendar.)</p>
<p>Additionally, we wanted the ability to make core changes without breaking a lot
of old applications. This doesn't mean a migration is difficult though. Having
two different namespaces allows you to keep your current Dancer 1 applications
running alongside your new Dancer2 applications and make it simple to migrate
when <b>you</b> are ready.</p>
<p>Following are a few tips for migrating your applications to Dancer2, finishing
with one great resource for it at the end.</p>
<h2><a name="it_s_all_about_the_plack"></a>It's all about the Plack</h2>

<p>Dancer originally wasn't built for <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack">Plack</a>. When Plack came out, Dancer has
made the necessary changes to accommodate it. However, it wasn't the leading
spec for Dancer, as it was simply a port of another framework from Ruby.</p>
<p>Dancer2 took a different approach: Plack leads the way. This led to quite a few
changes in removing unnecessary code, producing much more correct behavior,
and providing more deterministic results.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Each_class_is_an_entire_app"></a><b>Each class is an entire app</b>
<p>A Dancer App is now every class which consumes <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a>. This means they
can each have their own configuration, allowing different engines:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">package Admin {
    use Dancer2;
    ...
}

package Public {
    use Dancer2;
    ...
}</pre>

<p>Now <code>Admin</code> and <code>Public</code> are fully independent applications. They
will not share any resources and will be able to have different engines
(template, session, serializer, logger) which will not be shared. No more
worrying about globals.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Removing___script__import_key_for_plackup"></a><b>Removing ':script' import key for plackup</b>
<p>Dancer 1 had the <code>:script</code> import key which would read your command line
arguments to change how the Dancer server would run.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack">Plack</a> has the <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/plackup">plackup</a> command line tool, it already reads your
command line arguments. Why make a duplicate effort?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Fully_object_oriented"></a><b>Fully object-oriented</b>
<p>Dancer2 has changed its core substantially to be much more object oriented.
Now the core is implemented in objects. The DSL layer simply provides an
interface to those objects.</p>
<p>This makes everything much easier to compose and test.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_HTTP__Server__Simple_replaced_with_HTTP__Server__PSGI"></a><b>HTTP::Server::Simple replaced with HTTP::Server::PSGI</b>
<p>Originally Dancer would use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Server::Simple">HTTP::Server::Simple</a> which supported PSGI, but
it was a pain to use, since it had issues we needed to patch and provided a
dependency we weren't happy about.</p>
<p>As it happens, <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack">Plack</a> comes with a great development server called
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Server::PSGI">HTTP::Server::PSGI</a>. Since we're building on Plack, we might as well make use
of it. This is why Dancer2 uses it instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="migration_in_a_nutshell"></a>Migration in a nutshell</h2>

<p>Okay, but putting all of that aside, how do I migrate?</p>
<p>Well, it really depends on what you do with your application, but here are our
main migration tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Clean_importing"></a><b>Clean importing</b>
<p>All of the importing keywords are unnecessary now, except for <code>appname</code>,
explained below.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Separate_serialized_routes"></a><b>Separate serialized routes</b>
<p>Routes that require serializers should be separated to their own Dancer2 app,
since serializers will try to deserialize all input and serialize all output
in every route in their app scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_DSL_keyword_changes"></a><b>DSL keyword changes</b>
<p>We tried to change very little of the DSL. <code>load</code> and <code>param_array</code> no
longer exist, and <code>session</code> can also provide the session object, not just
retrieve and set values for keys.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Applications_are_self_dispatching_units"></a><b>Applications are self-dispatching units</b>
<p>As explained above, any module that uses <code>Dancer2</code> becomes a Dancer
Application, which creates a separated dispatcher only for the routes created
under that module namespace.</p>
<p>The application's engines will not be shared with others - an issue that
pained experienced developers of Dancer 1.</p>
<p>If you want to compose multiple Dancer Applications to create a single web
application, you can use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Builder">Plack::Builder</a> and <code>to_app</code>. Stay tuned for
an article explaining this exact situation.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Multiple_packages_for_a_single_app"></a><b>Multiple packages for a single app</b>
<p>Allowing multiple packages to create a single Dancer Application is also
possible using the <code>appname</code> feature. This will also appear in an upcoming
article.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="you_said_something_about_a_great_resource"></a>You said something about a great resource?</h2>

<p>Oh yes!</p>
<p>Writing down all the migration changes between Dancer 1 and Dancer2 would be
too much. Plus, who would check this article after a while again to see if it
was updated? No one, that's who!</p>
<p>Instead, we've compiled a list (with the kind help of Snigdha Dagar) of all
of these changes under <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2::Manual::Migration">Dancer2::Manual::Migration</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in migrating your applications to Dancer2, or would like
to write a new application and care to know what the differences are, you should
consult it.</p>
<p>Of course we welcome any changes and improvements to this document as it is a
living breathing document (which we hope will not attack us during Halloween),
so feel free to submit pull requests, send comments on the mailing list, or
stop by the IRC channel.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Dancer2 has a few changes that promote much more consistent and deterministic
web application development. It reduces the considerations we have to take
into account while providing much more correct implementations for various
pieces.</p>
<p>Our new Migration Document helps new-comers and seasoned developers keep
up-to-date with the changes we've done and how it might affect their future
code.</p>
