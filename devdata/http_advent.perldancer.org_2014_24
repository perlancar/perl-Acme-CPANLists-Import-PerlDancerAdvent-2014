<p>
The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<div class="pod-document"><h1><a name="past_and_future"></a>Past and future</h1>

<p>This last article is meant to reflect on the past, in the present,
and speculate about the future, perhaps even - with the cover of
darkness - offer some future plans, in quiet murmur, of course. :)</p>
<h2><a name="popularity"></a>Popularity</h2>

<p>We all care about popularity. Popularity isn't just cool factor, it's
also a measurement of success - doing well, going in the right direction.</p>
<p>But how do you measure popularity? It's
<a href="http://blog.timbunce.org/2008/04/12/tiobe-or-not-tiobe-lies-damned-lies-and-statistics/">hard</a>.</p>
<p>We have different mechanisms made just to measure success. In our
world that would Github stars, Github watchers, and even MetaCPAN
votes. However, if you take a look at Moose, it only has 78 stars on Github, and
only 15 watchers. Would you say Moose is less successful than Dancer? Not
at all. This measurement simply is far from accurate.</p>
<p>However, there is another way to measure popularity.</p>
<p>One of my favorite and most respected authors provides the following
comment in all of his projects:</p>
<p><i>All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to
cpan-RT.</i></p>
<p>Complex software accumulates tickets. These are bugs, feature requests,
failing tests, missing tests, questions, and so on. Hopefully authors
will collect these in a ticket system like RT or Github.</p>
<p>The amount of tickets you have indicates how many of these came up. While
some authors will open a staggering amount of tickets for their projects
(which is nothing short of being thorough and responsible) and projects
may have a devoted user who opens tickets upon tickets, most tickets are
opened by the audience of users. The number indicates how many have used your
software to a degree of contacting you, providing input, and found you or
your project approachable and tried to help improve it.</p>
<p>You can count the number of tickets for a project, remove the core authors
(and check for when they weren't core authors yet - it happens sometimes),
normalize to amount of users opening the issues, and look at the numbers.</p>
<p>Dancer has two main repositories: Dancer 1 and Dancer 2. Together they have
accumulated around 1,900 tickets. Yes, that's close to <b>two thousand</b>
tickets. About 1,000 of them are pull requests. Yes, that's right. Over
<b>one thousand</b> pull requests. Actually, my numbers are off. I only took
into account Github. Dancer has been running on RT earlier and there's a
quite a few there as well. That would also be off, because we accept
tickets through any medium. We get them in personal emails, on the mailing
list, at conferences, on IRC, and so on.</p>
<p>Beyond all measurements, I'd say we reached people. More importantly,
I would say these people reached us. I cannot be more proud of this
achievement.</p>
<p>I can talk about <a href="http://www.booking.com">Booking</a> using Dancer. I can
talk about <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com">Shutterstock</a> using Dancer. I can
talk about <a href="http://www.moonfruit.com">MoonFruit</a>, <a href="http://www.uk2.net">UK2</a>,
<a href="https://www.tilt.com">Tilt</a>, <a href="https://www.financejobs.co">FinanceJobs</a>,
<a href="http://perlmaven.com">PerlMaven</a>, <a href="http://geekuni.com">Geekuni</a>, the
<a href="http://www.strehler-cms.org">Strehler CMS</a>, and even a
<a href="http://www.finchleyspiritualistchurch.org.uk">spiritual church</a> and
an <a href="http://theanarchistlibrary.org">anarchist library</a> using Dancer.</p>
<p>I can talk about all of these, but that's not the great part. The great
part is our contributors.</p>
<h2><a name="contribution_is_key"></a>Contribution is key</h2>

<p>Having someone contributing their time and skill is priceless. Contributors
are the life-force of a project - not the core developers. Almost any
core developer in Free and Open Source will undoubtedly tell you that
development's gratitude is someone using it, thanking you for it, or better
yet, improving it further by contributing something - a test, a documentation
patch, or even opening tickets.</p>
<p>Except for Dancer's founder, Alexis (<i>@sukria</i>) Sukrieh, all Dancer core
developers started as contributors. This includes yours truly and everyone
else in the team. This hasn't changed since. We always saw and see ourselves
simply as contributors with more responsibility.</p>
<p>Dancer has enjoyed the help of an astonishing amount of contributors. Overall,
the Dancer project has received contributions from over 270 people. While this
seems big it fails to account for many contributors and many forms of
contribution. It's merely the number of recognized code committers.</p>
<p>Sam Batschelet organized the Dancer conference, Gabor Szabo took the Dancer
website under his care, Peter Martini provided a Dancer Docker image, David
Dick packages the project for Fedora, Paul Cochrane is working on improving
the documentation for beginners, and there are numerous other examples for
tremendous work done by the community.</p>
<p>Let me take a moment to thank you all for the work you've done and the
work that you do, in the community and for the community.</p>
<p>So now, where is all of this heading?</p>
<h2><a name="what_the_future_holds___"></a>What the future holds...</h2>

<p>It's hard to say what the future holds for Dancer, but we do have quite
a few plans.</p>
<p>The short list contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Thorough_documentation_overhaul"></a><b>Thorough documentation overhaul</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Improve_the_plugin_system_for_Dancer2"></a><b>Improve the plugin system for Dancer2</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Port_all_useful_plugins_to_Dancer2"></a><b>Port all useful plugins to Dancer2</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Rewrite_fair_portions_of_the_testing_suite"></a><b>Rewrite fair portions of the testing suite</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Many_core_cleanups"></a><b>Many core cleanups</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Additional_functionality"></a><b>Additional functionality</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Speed_optimizations"></a><b>Speed optimizations</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Compatibility_shims"></a><b>Compatibility shims</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Code_linting"></a><b>Code linting</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We even have some idea regarding features we want to introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Full_asynchronous_support"></a><b>Full asynchronous support</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Route_naming"></a><b>Route naming</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Chained_hooks"></a><b>Chained hooks</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Stronger_command_line_tooling"></a><b>Stronger command line tooling</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_More_decoupling_of_components"></a><b>More decoupling of components</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are plenty of ideas and the opportunities are abound.</p>
<p>While we want to add some of these features as quickly as possible, we
need to make sure we get them right, that we design them well, that we
do not overlap with other features, and that we don't have to revert them.</p>
<p>In fact, what we need is your help.</p>
<p>I can promise some will be difficult to implement, some will take
considerable time, and some will be like trudging through mud (especially
any OS compatibility work), but above all, I can promise you will have a good
time. :)</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone for an amazing year. I hope to see you and
work with you this new year and provide you all with another set of articles
at the next Advent Calendar.</p>
<p>Have a merry Christmas, a wonderful Hanukkah, and a tremendous Festivus,
for the rest of us!</p>
