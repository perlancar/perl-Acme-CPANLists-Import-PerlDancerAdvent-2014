<p>Perl has an extensive culture of testing which originated in the Perl
language itself, carrying a staggering number of tests for its own
features.</p>
<p>We write a multitude of tests for every single bit in our distributions and
we test them across different platforms, setups, versions of modules and
applications, and even on different versions of perl[1] itself.</p>
<p>For non-Perl regulars, you might think I'm exaggerating. Oh no, I'm not.
Check out <a href="http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/">CPANTS, our CPAN Testing Service</a>
for more details on our amazing free Perl testing service.</p>
<p>It's safe to say: we love tests.</p>
<p><i>[1] We use <b>Perl</b> (uppercase) for the language and <b>perl</b> (lowercase)
for the interpreter</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="but_in_the_land_of_web___"></a>But in the land of web...</h2>

<p>In the world of web, testing is trickier. A web application runs on a web
server. That is usually an application written in another language (often
C or C++), a long-running process with lots of configuration files and
behavior that is hard to decouple.</p>
<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/LWP">LWP</a> Gave us <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/LWP::UserAgent">LWP::UserAgent</a> which gave us <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/WWW::Mechanize">WWW::Mechanize</a>. As long
as we had a web server running, we could just write some tests (turned on
with an environment variable) that will make requests and test the results,
producing proper TAP. There's even <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Test::WWW::Mechanize">Test::WWW::Mechanize</a> to make it
smoother.</p>
<p>However, these don't handle the problem with testing in a web environment:
the web server itself.</p>
<h2><a name="enter_psgi"></a>Enter PSGI</h2>

<p>Any web application built on a <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/PSGI">PSGI</a> framework allows to approach the
problem from an entirely different perspective.</p>
<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/PSGI">PSGI</a> applications (such as those created with Dancer) are actually
code references fed to a web server. This means that as long as you create
the proper request (specified by the <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/PSGI">PSGI</a> docs), you can call that
application code reference with it and receive a response. No server is
actually necessary. The server is merely there to create a proper
request.</p>
<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack">Plack</a>, the set of utilities for <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/PSGI">PSGI</a> applications, comes with a
special module to help this process: <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Test">Plack::Test</a>.</p>
<p>What <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Test">Plack::Test</a> does is truly fantastic: it receives a common web
request (using standard <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Request">HTTP::Request</a> objects), fakes a web
server in order to create a proper PSGI request, and sends it to the web
application. When the web application returns a PSGI response (which Dancer
applications do), it will then convert it to a common web response (as a
standard <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Response">HTTP::Response</a> object).</p>
<p>This allows you to then create requests in your test, create the code
reference for your web application, call them, and receive a response
object, which you can then test to your heart's delight.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a few examples.</p>
<h2><a name="basic_example"></a>Basic example</h2>

<p>Assuming we have a web application:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># MyApp.pm
package MyApp;
use Dancer2;
get '/' =&gt; sub {'OK'};
1;</pre>

<p>Now we want to write a test for it. Let's create <i>base.t</i>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># base.t
use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More tests =&gt; 2;
use Plack::Test;
use HTTP::Request;
use MyApp;</pre>

<p>Now let's create a coderef for our application using the <code>to_app</code> keyword:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">my $app = MyApp-&gt;to_app;</pre>

<p>That was easy. Now let's create a test object from <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Test">Plack::Test</a> for our
application:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">my $test = Plack::Test-&gt;create($app);</pre>

<p>Now we can call requests on it. We'll create our first request object and
send it to our test object to receive a response:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">my $request  = HTTP::Request-&gt;new( GET =&gt; '/' );
my $response = $test-&gt;request($request);</pre>

<p>We can now test it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">ok( $response-&gt;is_success, '[GET /] Successful request' );
is( $response-&gt;content, 'OK', '[GET /] Correct content' );</pre>

<h2><a name="putting_it_all_together"></a>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>If we put all our code together and remove some excess, we can come up
with the following test file:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># base.t
use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More;
use Plack::Test;
use HTTP::Request::Common;
use MyApp;

my $test     = Plack::Test-&gt;create( MyApp-&gt;to_app );
my $response = $test-&gt;request( GET '/' );

ok( $response-&gt;is_success, '[GET /] Successful request' );
is( $response-&gt;content, 'OK', '[GET /] Correct content' );

done_testing();</pre>

<p>It might seem like too much boilerplate, but there's enough modules to
help you reduce that.</p>
<h2><a name="subtests"></a>Subtests</h2>

<p>We also separate our tests using <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Test::More">Test::More</a>'s <code>subtest</code> functionality,
thus creating multiple self-contained tests that don't overwrite each other.</p>
<p>Assuming we have a different app that has two states we want to test.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># MyApp.pm
package MyApp;
use Dancer2;
set serializer =&gt; 'JSON';

get '/' =&gt; sub {
    my $user = param('user');

    $user and return { user =&gt; $user };

    return {};
};

1;</pre>

<p>This is a very contrived example of a route that checks for a user
parameter. If it exists, it returns it in a hash with the key 'user'. If
not, it returns an empty hash. Useful? Probably not, but a good example
for having two tests.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># param.t
use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More;
use Plack::Test;
use HTTP::Request::Common;
use MyApp;

my $test = Plack::Test-&gt;create( MyApp-&gt;to_app );

subtest 'A empty request' =&gt; sub {
    my $res = $test-&gt;request( GET '/' );
    ok( $res-&gt;is_success, 'Successful request' );
    is( $res-&gt;content '{}', 'Empty response back' );
};

subtest 'Request with user' =&gt; sub {
    my $res = $test-&gt;request( GET '/?user=sawyer_x' );
    ok( $res-&gt;is_success, 'Successful request' );
    is( $res-&gt;content '{"user":"sawyer_x"}', 'Empty response back' );
};

done_testing();</pre>

<p>We could, of course, use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JSON">JSON</a> to decode and check for a proper object,
which would be the right thing for a bigger response. Did I say
<i>contrived</i> yet? :)</p>
<h2><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</h2>

<p>One interesting requirement is being able to handle cookies, mostly used
for maintaining sessions. We can use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI">Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI</a> or
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/LWP::Protocol::PSGI">LWP::Protocol::PSGI</a>, I personally prefer using <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Cookies">HTTP::Cookies</a> directly.</p>
<p>Taking the previous test, assuming it actually creates and uses cookies
for sessions, all we would need is the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># ... all the use statements
use HTTP::Cookies;

my $jar  = HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new;
my $test = Plack::Test-&gt;create( MyApp-&gt;to_app );
my $host = 'http://127.0.0.1';

subtest 'A empty request' =&gt; sub {
    my $res = $test-&gt;request( GET "$host/" );
    ok( $res-&gt;is_success, 'Successful request' );
    is( $res-&gt;content '{}', 'Empty response back' );
    $jar-&gt;extract_cookies($res);
    ok( $jar-&gt;as_string, 'We have cookies!' );
};

subtest 'Request with user' =&gt; sub {
    my $req = GET "$host/?user=sawyer_x";
    $jar-&gt;add_cookie_header($req);
    my $res = $test-&gt;request($req);
    ok( $res-&gt;is_success, 'Successful request' );
    is( $res-&gt;content '{"user":"sawyer_x"}', 'Empty response back' );
    $jar-&gt;extract_cookies($res);

    ok( ! $jar-&gt;as_string, 'All cookies deleted' );
};

done_testing();</pre>

<p>Here we create a cookie jar, make sure all our requests and responses work
with it, and we can even check for existing cookies, as well as cookies
that were deleted by the response, since <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Cookies">HTTP::Cookies</a> will understand
a delete request (by setting an older time) and delete it.</p>
<p>You will notice that we use a full domain. This is because
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Cookies">HTTP::Cookies</a> needs the entire URL (including the scheme part) to make
the cookies work.</p>
<h2><a name="accessing_the_configuration_file"></a>Accessing the configuration file</h2>

<p>By importing <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a> in your command line scripts, you have full
access to the configuration using the imported keywords:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More;
use Plack::Test;
use HTTP::Request::Common;
use MyApp;
use Dancer2;

my $appname = config-&gt;{'appname'};
diag "Testing $appname";

# ...</pre>

<p>In this example we use the <code>config</code> keyword to access the
configuration. That's all you have to do if you want to access it as part
of your test.</p>
<h2><a name="testing_environment"></a>Testing environment</h2>

<p>You can also set your own environment file for testing, such as
<code>environments/testing.yml</code> and then load it in your test script:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">BEGIN { $ENV{'DANCER_ENV'} = 'testing' }
# ...</pre>

<p>Now you can insert your own configurations.</p>
<h2><a name="setup_method"></a>Setup method</h2>

<p>My current favorite method for dynamically handling onfigurations in my
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a> applications is by having a <code>setup</code> method. When loading my
applications in my handlers, I call that method, and it then checks the
configuration for variables.</p>
<p>This allows me to tweak and change the configuration before calling the
<code>setup</code> method, thus letting me bootstrap my own changes, such as in
testing scripts.</p>
<p>A separate article about this trick just might appear on the Advent
Calendar this year.</p>
<h2><a name="where_are_the_test_helpers"></a>Where are the test helpers?</h2>

<p>Both Dancer 1 and 2 have <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Test">Dancer::Test</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2::Test">Dancer2::Test</a>, respectively,
but in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a> it is currently not recommended.</p>
<p>The reason is that, because they weren't written with PSGI in mind, they
are bending over backwards in order to fake the request, run it against
a fake dispatcher, and then return a fake response.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it isn't only buggy and took a lot of our time and
efforts into maintaining it, but it is also counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>We might reinstate it later, once we've redesigned it to simply be a helper
layer on top of <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Test">Plack::Test</a>.</p>
<p>For now, we suggest to avoid it and go directly for <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Test">Plack::Test</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Writing tests is a lot of fun and they help us make sure our applications
work the way we want them to work. They help flesh out features, APIs,
and maintain their correctness throughout changes, big and small.</p>
<p>Writing tests for web application used to be difficult, but now, with the
magic of <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/PSGI">PSGI</a>, it is simple and straight-forward.</p>
<p>You can read more about testing in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2::Manual::Testing">Dancer2::Manual::Testing</a>.</p>
<p>Our next article will cover how we write tests ourselves in the <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer2">Dancer2</a>
core.</p>
